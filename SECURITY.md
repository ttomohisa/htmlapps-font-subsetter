# Security Policy

## Supported version

Security fixes target the latest version on the default branch.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not publish sensitive vulnerability details in a public issue. Use the repository owner's private security reporting channel when available.

Include:

- Affected commit or version.
- Reproduction steps.
- Expected and actual behavior.
- Security impact.
- A minimal test file when file parsing is involved.

## Trust model

The default template is a static browser application with no backend. Its primary protections are:

- No ordinary runtime CDN/API connection (`connect-src 'none'`). Optional peer-to-peer WebRTC must be explicit in the product specification and must not introduce hidden signaling/STUN/TURN services.
- Explicitly pinned and embedded third-party files.
- Committed `dependencies.lock.json` tarball SHA-256 values verified before embedding.
- SHA-256 records in the generated dependency manifest.
- No analytics, telemetry, remote fonts, or silent update checks.
- Both the readable page and self-extract loader permit embedded WASM compilation with `wasm-unsafe-eval`, never general `unsafe-eval`. The loader policy remains effective after restoring the app, so it must permit the embedded font worker while keeping `connect-src 'none'`.
- User-initiated downloads rather than automatic uploads.
- The coverage report is copied to the local clipboard only on an explicit click. It includes font filenames, counts/status, and at most 500 missing Unicode labels per font, with control characters escaped. It excludes font bytes and source text, adds no storage or network path, and should be reviewed before the user shares clipboard contents.

A generated HTML file is executable code. Distribute it through a trusted channel and verify hashes for high-trust workflows.

If an app uses `components/webrtc-qr-pairing.html`, treat the paired browser as an explicit data recipient. “No server upload” does not mean “data never leaves this device.” Keep the manual signaling and `iceServers: []` boundary visible in the UI/help text, and do not silently add STUN/TURN later.

## Input files

Applications created from this template may parse untrusted local files. Implementations should:

- Treat filenames as untrusted text. Use DOM text/attribute assignment or HTML escaping for display and accessible labels; preserve legitimate characters rather than interpreting names as markup.
- Validate type, size, and structure before expensive processing.
- Avoid unbounded allocation or recursion.
- Handle malformed data without exposing stack traces to users.
- Release Blob URLs, workers, canvas resources, and large buffers.
- Make destructive transformations reversible where practical.
- Never upload a selected file unless the product explicitly requires it and the user is clearly informed.

## Dependency review

Before adding or upgrading a package:

- Confirm the package identity and exact version.
- Review the scheduled dependency Issue; never treat an available update as an automatic approval to upgrade.
- Review its license and required notices.
- Inspect the browser bundle and package scripts.
- Confirm every runtime support asset is embedded.
- Refresh the selected lock entry with the dependency scripts; never hand-edit a lock hash to bypass a mismatch.
- Rebuild with a clean cache.
- Test with the network disabled.
